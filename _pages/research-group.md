## Information for Prospective Students
If you want to apply for admission, you are advised to apply through the [PhD Admission of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/study/phd/). If you are interested in my research areas, please suggest Dr. Cong Ling as your future supervisor in the application form. You are recommended to pursue the MSc degree first (although this is not mandatory) if you have a Bachelor's degree only. Feel free to contact me should you have any queries. I apologize that I am unable to reply to everyone due to the large number of emails. I will contact you if further information is needed.

Departmental funding is available to support PhD students. The College also runs a number of [scholarships](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/fees-and-funding/scholarships/) for PhD students. In particular, excellent applicants who are nationals of China are advised to apply for the [CSC-Imperial Scholarship](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/fees-and-funding/scholarships/international-scholarship-collaborations/csc/) or the [CSC Scholarship](http://www.csc.edu.cn/).
