My research covers coding and information theory, post-quantum cryptography, communications and signal processing, with an emphasis on lattices and their applications. A lattice is a regular array of points which generalizes the concept of the integers to multiple dimensions. Lattices are central objects in modern number theory, underpin sphere packing and capacity-achieving codes, and are the leading approach to post-quantum cryptography. Our work lies at the interface of information theory, number theory, cryptography and quantum information.
